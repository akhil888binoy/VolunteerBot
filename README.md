# MailRobo

MailRobo is an email traffic control robot designed to automate the management of emails related to event planning and organization. Its features include automatic email filtering, email prioritization, automatic replies, email forwarding, saving emails in separate folders, downloading attachments to a separate folder, and generating a management summary report to be sent to relevant authorities.

## Inspiration

The inspiration behind MailRobo was to help event organizers and party planners manage their overwhelming inbox traffic. As frequent event organizers ourselves, we found it difficult to keep track of all the emails we received from vendors, sponsors, and attendees. With MailRobo, we aimed to simplify the email management process, saving time and reducing stress for event organizers.

## How to use

To use MailRobo, you will need to have UiPath installed on your machine. Once installed, simply open the MailRobo workflow and configure the different email management features to suit your needs. You can also customize the robot to work with popular event management software, such as Eventbrite and Cvent.
